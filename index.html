        <span class="box-desc-text"><b>Why Smoking is Bad For Everyone:</b><br>Smoking causes multiple diseases, holding chemicals that are carcinogens and mutagen that causes damages to our DNA, and most crucially, holds nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance, and causes addiction to many people. With the combination of addictive nicotine and these dangerous substances inside smoking, no wonder why smoking is the leading cause of diseases. A study made by the Australian Institute of Health and welfare says that “tobacco was the leading factor contributing to death and disease”, and is responsible for 9% of the total burden of disease and injury.<br>There’s also a severe economic cost as well. 31.5 billion dollars is lost every year from damages of 15000 people who have lost their lives due to smoking related illnesses in Australia, far outweighing the 10 billion dollar tax revenue from tobacco companies. <br><b>The Issue We are Trying To Solve:</b><br>
            #adolescent addiction#K. The issue that our nation is facing is that 18 to 21 year olds are still becoming addicted to smoking. This is a greater issue than normal smoking addiction that adults are facing, as mature adolescents are still undergoing crucial physiological development, and a long term smoking addiction would severely affect their life, even more than fully grown adults. Not to mention the role of cigarettes as a gateway drug. A research done by the National Institutes of Health, stated that “90% of adult cocaine users between the ages of 18 and 34 had smoked cigarettes”, it has also suggested that nicotine intake would increase cocaine addiction, as investigators “found that 7 days of nicotine administration caused a 61% increase in FosB expression(a gene linked to cocaine addiction). When given a dose of cocaine, (the test) mice had an additional 74% increase in FosB expression compared to mice treated with cocaine alone.” The research also says in the introduction that “The finding suggests that lowering smoking rates in young people might help reduce cocaine abuse.<br><b>The solution</b><br>To combat these issues Quit Victoria has proposed a new law that will increase the smoking age to 21. This law would not affect any other rights such as drinking, driving, or voting for 18 year olds        </span>        </div>
